<b>If you had only one shot: Scale and herding in innovation experiments</b><br>

<i>With Ashish Arora and Sharique Hasan</i><br><br>

<i>Abstract:</i> Solving complex problems --- in medicine, engineering, and other technological domains --- 
often requires exploring multiple approaches, particularly when significant uncertainty exists about which one will lead to success.
Conventional wisdom assumes that having many experimenters independently decide which approaches to pursue increases diversity and, 
thus, the chances of finding a solution. However, if experimenters herd toward the most promising approach, this convergence may reduce 
diversity and thus the likelihood of solving the problem. In this paper, we develop a simple model to show that, holding the total number 
of experiments constant, markets dominated by a few large-scale experimenters---firms conducting multiple experiments---explore more 
diverse approaches than markets with many single-shot experimenters. Single-shot experimenters tend to converge on the most promising approach, 
while multi-experimenters are more likely to diversify to avoid the correlation inherent in pursuing multiple experiments within the same approach. 
We test our model's predictions using data from pharmaceutical R&D.   Our analysis shows that increasing the average number of experiments per 
firm by one unit raises target diversity by over three standard deviations. In turn, a one-standard-deviation increase in target diversity boosts 
the likelihood of at least one experiment reaching Phase 1 clinical trials by 25.9 percentage points. Our findings highlight the need for 
technology policies that optimize experiment allocation across firms to maximize approach diversity and market-level success.

<b>Blockbusters, Sequels, and the Nature of Innovation</b><br>

<i>Abstract:</i>  Why do large firms pursue incremental innovations? In this paper, we argue that firms with high-selling, "blockbuster" products are more likely to pursue 
incremental innovations related to those products, even when controlling for overall firm size. Drawing on detailed product-level data from the pharmaceutical 
industry, we show that firms with \$1 billion drugs develop new products that closely resemble those existing blockbusters. This behavior, driven by 
demand- and supply-side adjustment costs, limits firms' incentives to invest in more radical innovations. Crucially, the blockbuster model is associated 
with firms forgoing opportunities in commercially promising markets. Our findings provide insights into how blockbuster products shape firms’ innovation choices, 
with implications for understanding the dynamics of technological change in industries characterized by high innovation intensity.

<b>Opinion Trumps Fact: Entrepreneurship and Competition in Political News</b><br>

<i>With Ronnie Chatterji, Sharique Hasan, and Dror Shvadron</i><br><br>

<i>Abstract:</i> New entrants create and capture value by serving unmet needs and competing with incumbent firms that might otherwise be slow to change their product offerings. 
But entry can also lead to unintended consequences for the industry and society. We analyze the impact of entrepreneurship and competition in the American political 
news business from 2014 to 2021. We find that entrepreneurs produced news content that was much more opinionated than incumbents, with more editorializing and 
persuasive language. However, this increased competition---especially from opinionated entrants---led incumbent firms to adopt a similar content strategy. 
We also find that on Twitter, these opinions triggered more social media posts that were likely to contain hate speech and expressions of anger. 
Nevertheless, this strategy failed to translate into website traffic, a key performance indicator. Our findings highlight the unexpected effect of media 
entrepreneurship. Entrants disrupted the traditional news business by making it more opinionated, leading to polarization without better business performance.

<b>From Founders to Funders: Generalized Reciprocity and Embeddedness in Founders’ Transition to Angel Investing</b>

<i>With Alessandro Piazza</i><br><br>

<i>Abstract:</i> This study examines the transition of entrepreneurs to angel investors through the lens of generalized reciprocity and embeddedness. 
We theorize that for founders, receiving funding from individual angel investors, rather than exclusively from venture capital sources, 
makes the transition to angel investing more likely. Furthermore, we posit that embeddedness between the entrepreneur and angel investor 
amplifies this effect. Drawing on social exchange theory and the notion of embeddedness, we develop hypotheses that we then test through 
an archival study of venture-backed founders and a vignette experiment. Our findings support the role of both generalized reciprocity and 
embeddedness in shaping the likelihood of entrepreneurs becoming angel investors. Entrepreneurs who received angel funding were more likely 
to become angel investors themselves, with this effect intensified when they shared educational, professional, or geographic ties with their 
angel investors. These results enrich our understanding of reciprocity dynamics in entrepreneurial ecosystems, highlighting the importance 
of interpersonal connections in capital flows. Our study also contributes to the literature on generalized reciprocity and embeddedness 
while underscoring the prosocial dimension of angel investing and its unique role in venture financing, with relevant implications for 
fostering self- sustaining entrepreneurial ecosystems.
